Documentation and download: <https://www.duosecurity.com/docs/oam>

# Development

If you want to build the plugin yourself, make sure you have JDK 6 (or higher) and Apache Maven installed.  Then run `mvn package` from the base directory.  This will generate a zip in the `target` directory that contains the necessary `.jar` and `.war` files.

This repository is a read-only mirror of the official plugin repository, so we cannot accept pull requests via GitHub.  Please use a GitHub issue for any requests or bugs.
